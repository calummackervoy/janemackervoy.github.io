         Jane Mackervoy paints large-scale vibrant flowers and plants which are assembled into colourful, sometimes abstract, compositions.
       </p>
       <p>
         Whilst her work is inspired by many artists, she is particularly drawn to the colours of Bonnard and Matisse, and the large scale, sensual work of Georgia O’Keefe.
       </p>
       <p>
         Jane believes that our response to colour is intensely emotional. As Matisse yearned for “the bright colours that stir the heart of man”, Jane too uses colour to explore and convey feelings. In her work she creates a mood through the visual sense and without words.
       </p>
       <p>
         Flowers can encompass and hold many meanings, often triggering intense emotions. They can make people happy, or they can simply be beautiful on their own.
       </p>
       <p>
         Jane revels in the subtle variations of form, the delicacy and symmetry. Flowers are so beautiful they appear to have acquired mastery in their creation.

         “Human subtlety will never devise an invention more beautiful, more simple, more direct than does nature because in her inventions nothing is lacking and nothing is superfluous.”

       <p>
         Jane Mackervoy is a Scottish artist based in Hertfordshire. The driving force behind her painting is the pure pleasure of creating, along with a firm belief that art need not be complicated.
       </p>
       <p>
         Jane studied at the Camberwell School of Art. As well as creating her own work, Jane enjoys teaching art to others.
